# NLP-Disaster-Tweets

**Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.**

**The challenge is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. This problem is significant because Twitter has become a vital platform for real-time communication, including during emergencies. Agencies and organizations can benefit from automatic monitoring of such tweets for efficient and effective disaster response. However, distinguishing between tweets that are genuinely reporting a disaster and those that are metaphorical or unrelated is challenging for a machine due to the nuances in human language.**

**Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. It involves building systems that can understand and interpret human language in a way that is valuable. Typical applications include translating texts, sentiment analysis, and, as in this case, text classification.**
